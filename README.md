Creating an intermediate level AI for a Tic-Tac-Toe game involves implementing a strategy that's more advanced than random moves but less complex than the Minimax algorithm used for hard difficulty. A typical approach for intermediate AI includes:

Winning Move: If the AI has a chance to win with one move, it takes it.
Blocking Move: If the opponent has a winning move on the next turn, the AI blocks it.
Center Move: If the center is free, the AI takes it.
Random Move: If none of the above apply, make a random move

Easy: Random moves (as in the current version).
Intermediate: A mix of random moves and some basic strategy (like taking the center or blocking the opponent).
Hard: A more advanced strategy using the Minimax algorithm.
